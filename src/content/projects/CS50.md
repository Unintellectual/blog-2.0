During my time studying Development Management Studies, I've been working on various projects to meet the requirements and complete the CS50 course at Harvard University. These projects have been like stepping stones, helping me learn programming, problem-solving, and how algorithms work. I've started with basic stuff and moved on to more complicated topics, and each project has been a chance for me to get better at computer science.

I've been tackling different challenges, from simple algorithms to building bigger software systems. Working on these projects has not only improved my skills but also made me appreciate how cool computer science can be. As I keep going, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and how much more I can learn in this fascinating field.
