This is the second version of my personal website, where I aim to show off what I've been working on to visitors. I'm really into back end development and love creating tools like libraries that other developers can use. While I'm really comfortable with coding, I'm also dipping my toes into the world of design aesthetics. However, my main aim is always to make sure things work seamlessly, focusing on functionality over flashy looks.
